Everyone should read more.

Currently this list is in table format, but I hope to upgrade it someday

| Title                       | Dependencies    | Blurb                                                | Rating | Ease |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|------|
| The things they carried (N) | Less                  | About war and storytelling. Go in blind.             |        |
| Enderverse (SF)             | Contact, 3BP          | What happens when humans encounter alien life.       |   6    |
| Arcadia (PL)                | R&G are dead          | Entropy, interleaving storylines, precocious protag  | 8      |
| Good Old Neon (SS)          | other DFW shorts      | Resonated strongly. Going meta. Rambling thoughts to psychologist.
| Sandman (GN)                | |Personifies the Endless, creatures above gods. The character growth of Dream. Starts slow.
| East of Eden (N)            | | Not like other Steinbeck. Human nature, good/evil, power of choice. Simple. Beautiful.
| Catch 22
| This is water
| Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead (PL) | Hamlet, | Hamlet from diff perspective. Tragicomedy. Decent movie version |
| 1Q84 (N)    |  Slighly postmodern. Hm...gives one a really weird feeling. Like slowly drops you out of reality in the way 100 years of solitude might. But more gradually. Feels like you should be building up to something, and then… you wake up. If you don’t feel immersed though, maybe not worth. Rec 1Q84 over the others because it did this do me, but maybe your first murakami is always good. 
| Ishmael (N)|   | Cute to go into blind. Felt nicer on the first read (didn’t hold up to rereading as well). Perspective-inducing/I didn’t love it but it stayed in my head a while
| Contact (SF) |   | Cute to go into blind. Felt nicer on the first read (didn’t hold up to rereading as well). Perspective-inducing/I didn’t love it but it stayed in my head a while
|Glass Bead Game/Magister Ludi (N) |    |  Waxing philosophical a bit
|The Unbearable Lightness of Being |    | Philosophical The only book I’ve read that I really thought “wow I would not have appreciated this a couple years ago”, so maybe wait on this one? I was in love with it from the first chapter. Resonated. 
| Invisible Cities (N...)   |     | You want to appreciate lit as art? ...postmodern. more like a beautiful atlas.
| Watchmen (GN)    |   Cute. Not earth-shattering, but a little bit of perspective + good for people who don’t necessarily like that many words

| Chaos (NF)  |   | Fun nearly-pop-sci-level intro to a different way of thinking about physics |   |
| Thinking, Fast and Slow (NF) |   | cognitive biases! Human heuristics and how they are generally good but may fail us. Very modular read. Don’t take it at object level, But knowing we have biases is both cool and important!  |    |

The Happiness Project (NF/SH) |   |   Cute “actionable” self help feel-good book. Very readable. 
This Is Water (E)  On the importance of the humanities. Very readable.
A Mathematician’s Lament (E)  |    | A strong opinion on the state of math education
